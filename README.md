# <Section 1 Homework - Code Refactor>

## Description

This project was a code refactoring project. The goal was to take a given code to the functional website and improve it in multiple ways.

- The main goal of this project was to bring the code up to better accessibility standards, I did this by adding alt tags to all image elements on the page, replacing div tags with more descriptive semantic elements, and ensuring the title of the page was an accurate and consise description.
- I also fixed some other problems with the page such as broken links, out of order nav items, and messy CSS. I commented each section of CSS to describe the function of it while also consolidating some redundant selectors to improve the efficiency of the styling.
- I learned about refactoring in general and that it seems to be a living project that can have many different answers and will never necessarily be perfect. You can tweak this here and that there and always try to be improving your efficiency or general cleanliness of coding.

## Installation

The link should be functional and the only necessary part in order to access the webpage.
